  m_text: "Is a free-standing doorframe that appears completely ordinary at first
    glance, standing at a height of 2.1 meters and a width of 1 meter. The frame
    itself is made of weathered wood, with subtle but intricate carvings resembling
    various unknown symbols that appear to shift slightly when observed for extended
    periods. There is no visible handle, knob, or locking mechanism on the door,
    and the doorframe does not lead to any visible door.\r\nWhen observed from a
    distance, it seems to simply exist as a doorway to an otherwise empty space,
    although no physical \"door\" exists. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear
    that the frame has the anomalous property of acting as a portal to an unknown
    or parallel environment, commonly referred to as the \"Elsewhere\" domain. \r\nWhen
    an individual passes through the doorframe, they will be transported to a parallel
    environment, commonly referred to as the \"Elsewhere\" domain. The Elsewhere
    domain is not consistent; each passage through results in a different manifestation
    of the parallel world. Some environments appear to be reflections of familiar
    locations, such as a distorted version of Earth, while others present entirely
    alien worlds where the laws of physics seem unpredictable. For example, gravity
    may fluctuate, and objects may appear to be suspended in mid-air or shift in
    size. Time in the Elsewhere domain is equally erratic\u2014some travelers report
    only seconds passing within, while others experience what feels like years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose
    who travel through the door often report a profound sense of isolation and disorientation.
    There are no known inhabitants of the Elsewhere domain, though some individuals
    have described hearing faint whispers or seeing fleeting shadowy figures from
    the corner of their eye. These entities, if they exist, are not fully understood
    and may not be human in nature. The longer an individual remains in the Elsewhere
    domain, the more their perception of reality seems to erode, with instances of
    hallucinations and fragmented memories increasing with time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen
    an individual is exposed to the Elsewhere domain for an unknown period, they
    will be involuntarily returned to the location. This return is not always guaranteed
    to occur in the same location as the initial passage; some individuals report
    reappearing miles or even kilometers away from the original point of entry, with
    no memory of how they arrived. Others have returned in a drastically altered
    state, physically or mentally affected by their time in the parallel environment.\r\n"
