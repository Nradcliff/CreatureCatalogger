  m_text: "Is a large, carnivorous entity with physical characteristics similar to
    that of a bear but with significant deviations from known terrestrial fauna.
    The creature\u2019s body is covered in coarse, dark brown to black fur, although
    patches of the skin beneath the fur have been observed to be thick, leathery,
    and resistant to damage.\r\nIts most distinctive feature is its head, which exhibits
    a broad, flattened face with a pronounced jaw and large, sharp canine teeth.
    The eyes are deeply sunken, and its pupils are vertically slit, much like that
    of a reptile or a feline predator. The creature\u2019s ears are small, round,
    and flattened, offering limited auditory sensitivity. Its has pronounced claws,
    which are capable of slashing through bone, steel, and concrete.\r\nThe creature\u2019s
    musculature is highly developed, and it can inflict fatal wounds with a single
    swipe of its claws to small and mid sized prey. It exhibits highly aggressive
    territorial behavior, with a particular aversion to encroachment into its established
    hunting grounds. It has been shown to exhibit extreme levels of aggression toward
    any potential intruders in its territory. Additionally, its aggressive behavior
    intensifies during breeding season, with it becoming even more protective of
    its territory and known lairs.\r\nHas been identified as a primarily nocturnal
    predator, hunting in the hours following dusk and into the night. It uses stealth
    (Its coat allowing it to blend seamlessly into its environment) and cunning to
    stalk and ambush prey, often targeting lone or isolated animals and occasionally
    human beings, particularly those who venture too deep into its territory. Reports
    indicate that it exhibits a highly intelligent hunting strategy, often laying
    in ambush or using terrain to its advantage. It is theorized that it may also
    be capable of vocalizing, though its calls remain undetected by normal human
    hearing.\r\n"
