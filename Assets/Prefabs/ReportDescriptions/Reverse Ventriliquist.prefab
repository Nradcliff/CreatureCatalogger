  m_text: "Is a humanoid puppet, measuring 45 cm (18 inches) in height, and is constructed
    from traditional materials, including wood, cloth, and string. The puppet is
    elegantly dressed in a tailored, vintage suit, complete with a vest, bowtie,
    and polished leather shoes, giving it an air of refinement and sophistication.
    Its facial features are classically styled, with a well-groomed mustache, neatly
    combed hair, and glass eyes that give the impression of being lifelike. \r\nWhen
    operated, it appears to be a normal puppet, with the expected movements controlled
    by strings or hand manipulation. However, its effect begins to manifest after
    a short period of interaction, typically within 5-10 minutes of being actively
    used. The puppet\u2019s influence grows subtly and gradually, first affecting
    the physical movements of the puppeteer, who begins to mirror the puppet\u2019s
    actions, often performing exaggerated or mechanical gestures that seem disconnected
    from their own intent.\r\nAs the interaction continues, the puppeteer\u2019s
    control over their own speech and movement weakens, with the subject\u2019s words
    and actions increasingly becoming dictated by the puppet. In extreme cases, the
    puppeteer may lose all autonomy, as their body is fully controlled by the puppet.
    The affected individual may act as though they are the puppet, mimicking its
    speech patterns, movements, and even adopting its mannerisms. The individual
    becomes a passive observer, fully aware of what is happening but unable to regain
    control of their body. The puppet does not appear to exert any direct physical
    harm on the puppeteer, but the psychological effects are profound, with the subject
    experiencing intense feelings of helplessness and frustration.\r\nIt is not actively
    hostile but instead operates under the assumption that it is simply \u201Cperforming\u201D
    with its puppeteer The puppet may occasionally display a form of ironic humor,
    such as making sarcastic remarks or acting in a manner that mocks the puppeteer\u2019s
    attempts at regaining control.\r\n"
