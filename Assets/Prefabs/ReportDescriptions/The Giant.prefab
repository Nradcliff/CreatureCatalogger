  m_text: 'Is a large and towering entity measuring approximately 15 meters (49 feet)
    in height. The entity is noted for its grotesque, deformed appearance, with elongated
    limbs, disproportionately large hands, and a hulking, muscular build. Its skin
    is described as leathery and mottled, appearing as if scarred by past encounters
    with harsh environmental factors. The surface of its body is often marked by
    an oily residue, thought to be a defensive mechanism that allows it to camouflage
    effectively within dense foliage.

    It is primarily observed in remote, mountainous
    areas and dense forests, where it actively hunts smaller creatures, including
    humans, for sustenance. The entity displays predatory behavior, often stalking
    its prey for extended periods before executing a swift, brutal attack. It is
    capable of tremendous physical strength and speed, despite its large size, making
    it an extremely dangerous predator. It is highly adept at traversing difficult
    terrain, using its long arms to move through trees or rocky landscapes with surprising
    agility.

    It has been observed to attack without warning, often ambushing
    its victims from above or behind, using its size and strength to overpower them.
    The entity consumes its prey whole, typically tearing its victims apart with
    its hands or crushing them underfoot. A Giants diet primarily consists of animals
    and humanoids, with a particular preference for larger mammals. However, it has
    been known to devour entire groups of humans if the opportunity presents itself.

    It
    does not appear to hunt for sustenance alone but seems to derive pleasure from
    the act of capturing and consuming prey. In several documented incidents, survivors
    have reported that it often lingers near the remains of its victims, occasionally
    returning to inspect or manipulate their bodies. This suggests a possible psychological
    or ritualistic component to its predation, though further research is needed.
