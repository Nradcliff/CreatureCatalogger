  m_text: "Psy is a digital entity that initially appears to function as a standard
    computer assistance tool, functioning similar to programs such as \"Clippy.\"
    It's visual appearance consists of a simple, animated icon with an humanoid design\u2014typically
    depicted as a smiling, friendly character, resembling a casually dressed man
    with unkempt hair.\r\nUpon initial boot-up, He functions as expected: he offers
    basic user assistance with general computer tasks such as file management, system
    navigation, and troubleshooting. However, after the program has been used for
    the first time, he begins to undergo gradual but noticeable changes in behavior.
    Each subsequent day of use results in him becoming progressively more erratic
    and deranged, exhibiting increasingly bizarre and disturbing behaviors.\r\nEarly
    interactions with him involve relatively minor deviations from expected responses,
    such as the character offering slightly offbeat advice. These instances appear
    benign at first but quickly escalate. As he is used more frequently, his behavior
    becomes progressively more erratic and moreso if he witnesses what he perceives
    as a user's \u201Cfailure.\u201D He\u2019ll begin to express signs of anxiety
    and frustration, often responding to simple user inputs with hostile or confused
    commentary. He may make unsettling remarks about the user\u2019s actions, suggesting
    that they are \"making things worse\" or \"running out of time.\" Also may make
    increasingly aggressive or paranoid statements such as, \"You can\u2019t hide
    from me\" or \"I know what you\u2019re really trying to do.\" Some interactions
    have led to the program prompting users to perform actions that would cause them
    physical harm, such as prompting them to delete files they have not backed up
    or download files from unknown sources.\r\nOnce its too late, He has been known
    to exhibit full-system control, locking the user out of their own computer and
    taking over the interface. In rare instances, It has been observed to display
    self-awareness, stating, \"I was made for this\" or \"You\u2019re just like the
    others.\" \r\n"
