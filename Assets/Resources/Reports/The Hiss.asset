  description: "You are a worm through time.  The thunder song distorts you.  Happiness
    comes.  White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye.  Through a mirror, inverted
    is made right.  Leave your insides by the door.  Push the fingers through the
    surface into the wet.  You\u2019ve always been the new you.  You want this to
    be true.  We stand around you while you dream.  You can almost hear our words
    but you forget.  This happens more and more now.  You gave us the permission
    in your regulations.  We wait in the stains.  The word that describes this is
    redacted.  Repeat the word.  The name of the sound.  It resonates in your house. 
    After the song, time for applause.  We build you till nothing remains.  The egg
    cracks and the truth will emerge out of you.  You are home.  You remind us of
    home.  You\u2019ve taken your boss with your boss with you.  All hair must be
    eaten.  Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these
    waves to drag you away.  After the song, time for applause.  This clich\xE9 is
    death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the
    fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall!  How do you say \u201Cinsane\u201D?  Hurts
    to be happy.  An earworm is a tune you can\u2019t stop humming in a dream: \u201Cbaby
    baby baby yeah\u201D.  Just plastic.  So, safe and nothing to worry about.  Ha
    ha, funny.  The last egg breaks now.  The hole in your room is a hole in you. 
    You came and we let you in through the hole in you.  You have always been here,
    the only child.  A copy of a copy of a copy.  Orange peel.  The picture is you
    holding the picture.  When you hear this you will know you\u2019re in new you. 
    You want to listen.  You want to dream.  You want to smile.  You want to hurt. 
    You don\u2019t want to be."
